# Optimization

Some optmization algorithms used in machine learning for Logistic Regression. 
The experiments are mainly build on Python3 and the dataset is from Exercise #2 Logistic Regression from Andrew Ng's "Machine learning course".

1. Traditional logistic regression with and without regulations:
check ex2.py and ex2_reg.py

2. Mini-Batch stochastic gradient descent:
Check ex2_reg_batch.py

3. Parallel batch stochastic gradient descent along the lines of Hogwild:
check ex2_parallel_batch.py
